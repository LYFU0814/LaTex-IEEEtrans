\section{The Design, Intent, and \\ Limitations of the Templates}
\label{sec:TheDesign}

The templates are intended to {\bf{approximate the final look and page length of the articles/papers}}. {\bf{They are NOT intended to be the final produced work that is displayed in print or on IEEEXplore\textsuperscript{\textregistered}}}. They will help to give the authors an approximation of the number of pages that will be in the final version. The structure of the \LaTeX\ files, as designed, enable easy conversion to XML for the composition systems used by the IEEE. The XML files are used to produce the final print/IEEEXplore pdf and then converted to HTML for IEEEXplore.
